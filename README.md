# real_time_clock

This is a basic verilog implementation of Real-time-clock

It is a basic verilog implementation of a real time clock where the clock is represented in the form of HH-MM-SS(24-hour format) in 6 LCD.
For this 6 counters need to be instantiated with some connectivity conditions from one counter to another counter.
Then these counters are interfaced with 7-segment displays.
